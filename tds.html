<p>Dear Deputy [Surname],</p>

<p>I am writing as your constituent in DÃºn Laoghaire and a long-standing member of the climbing community to bring to your attention serious concerns regarding the sudden prohibition of rock climbing at Dalkey Quarry, implemented on Monday, August 11th.</p>

<p>This decision directly contradicts the Council's recent official promotion of climbing at the quarry. As recently as July 2025, DLR Tourism was actively promoting climbing at Dalkey Quarry through social media posts describing it as "the perfect outdoor activity." The Council's own tourism publications, including the 2025 "Urban Splash" and "Well Worth the Climb" visitor guides, prominently feature rock climbing and abseiling at the quarry, listing multiple commercial operators. Until last month, the DLR Tourism website included a dedicated section promoting "Rock Climbing/Abseiling in Dalkey Quarry" with over 300 routes - this content has now been removed. I have archived copies of this promotional material.</p>

<p>The prohibition appears to have been implemented without prior public consultation or recorded discussion in County Council meeting minutes from September 2024 through July 2025. This is particularly concerning given that local bodies have provided recent grant funding to support climbing activities, and commercial operators promoted in Council materials now face immediate business disruption.</p>

<p>I have been climbing at Dalkey Quarry for over four years and have brought Scouts there for over a decade as a Scout Leader with my local Scout Group, covered under Scouting Ireland insurance. My children are also active climbers, and we use the quarry for club training and youth development. The quarry serves numerous community organisations for youth programmes and charity events, making it vital for skill-building, confidence, and safe outdoor recreation for all ages.</p>

<p>Climbing at Dalkey Quarry has been conducted responsibly for decades. Under the Occupiers' Liability Act 2023, participants in outdoor recreation are deemed to voluntarily accept inherent risks, providing significant protections for landowners through the voluntary assumption of risk defense. While this doesn't eliminate all potential liability concerns, it does provide a robust legal framework that should enable continued responsible use while risk assessments are conducted.</p>

<p>The Council has stated this prohibition is a precautionary measure pending a comprehensive safety assessment. However, if the quarry was considered safe enough for official promotion just weeks ago, a temporary prohibition during assessment seems disproportionate. A "climb at your own risk" approach would balance public safety with continued community access while the assessment proceeds.</p>

<p>I respectfully request that the Council:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suspend enforcement of the climbing prohibition and remove the prohibition signs pending completion of the safety assessment and meaningful public consultation</li>
<li>Engage transparently with stakeholders, including Mountaineering Ireland, affected businesses, and user groups, to develop a proportionate risk management approach</li>
<li>Publish the timeline and scope of the proposed safety assessment</li>
</ul>

<p>Dalkey Quarry is a nationally significant climbing venue and a vital part of our local sporting culture. The current approach undermines community trust and contradicts the Council's own recent tourism promotion. I urge you to support a measured response that recognizes both the quarry's established use and the need for any genuine safety concerns to be addressed through proper consultation.</p>
